# Nvim

I use this repo to keep track of my own neovim config.
Use it if you want but keep this in mind :

- It's made for **neovim nightly**.
- There's **no install script**.
- I don't always use pcall() so plugins config may break sometimes.
- There's **only some manually installed lsp servers**.
- The **file hierarchy is opiniated**.

Some parts of my config his taken from [Jose Elias Alvarez](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/dotfiles/tree/main/config/nvim).
His job in neovim ecosystem is already awesome !

If you're looking for a already configured neovim you may prefer these:
