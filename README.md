# Nvim

![startuptime](https://byob.yarr.is/n3wborn/nvim/startuptime)

I use this repo to keep track of my own neovim config.
Use it if you want but keep this in mind :

- It's made for **neovim nightly**
- There's **no install script**
- LSP servers must be installed/configured manually (I don't use [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim))

Some parts of my config where taken from:

- [Folke Lemaitre config](https://github.com/folke/dot/tree/master/nvim)
- [LazyVim/LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- [dbalatero/dotfiles](https://github.com/dbalatero/dotfiles)

If you're looking for an already configured neovim you may prefer these:

- [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)
- [Lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
- [Astrovim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)

Note about nvim-treesitter when switching from Packer to Lazy:

If nvim-treesitter keeps compiling ever parsers when starting Neovim, [read this](https://shorturl.at/aKSTU)
