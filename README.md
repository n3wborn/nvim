# Nvim

I use this repo to keep track of my own neovim config.
Use it if you want but keep this in mind :

- It's made for **neovim nightly**
- There's **no install script**
- LSP servers must be installed/configured manually
- I use [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager
- Some plugins are lazy loaded but there's still work to do

Some parts of my config his taken from:
    - [Folke Lemaitre config](https://github.com/folke/dot/tree/master/nvim)
    - [Jose Elias Alvarez config](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/dotfiles)
    - [LazyVim/LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
    - [dbalatero/dotfiles](https://github.com/dbalatero/dotfiles)

Folke and Jose contribute with amazing plugins and their dotfiles helped a lot, I'm really grateful for all this.
