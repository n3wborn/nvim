# Nvim

I use this repo to keep track of my own neovim config.
Use it if you want but keep this in mind :

- It's made for **neovim nightly**
- There's **no install script**
- LSP servers must be installed/configured manually (I don't use [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim))
- I use [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager
- I still use [jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) and [jose-elias-alvarez/typescript.nvim](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/typescript.nvim)
- Some plugins are lazy loaded but there's still work to do

Some parts of my config where taken from:
    - [Folke Lemaitre config](https://github.com/folke/dot/tree/master/nvim)
    - [LazyVim/LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
    - [dbalatero/dotfiles](https://github.com/dbalatero/dotfiles)

If you're looking for an already configured neovim you may prefer these:

- [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)
- [Lunarvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
- [Astrovim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)
